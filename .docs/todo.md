# Dendrite — Todo

The near future: what is being worked on now, and what comes straight after. Anything for
some later point in time is in `backlog.md`; finished work, kept for its reasoning, is in
`done.md`.

## The order after 0.6.1

`@dendrite-lang/editor` 0.6.1 is on npm since 2026-10-10 (`done.md`, "Editor 0.6.1 on npm");
core and link are at 0.6.0. What follows is the order the maintainer gave on 2026-10-08.
"Possibly" is the maintainer's word for the last two.

| Release | Holds | Entry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Next | Two symbols that want `?`: `??` and `c ? a : b` | below |
| 0.7, possibly | Union types, `A \| B` | `backlog.md`, "Language — union types" |
| 0.8, possibly | Strings as lists, with `Split`, `Slice` and `Replace` | `backlog.md`, "Language — strings as lists" |

Beside that order, with no release named for them: the three entries at the foot of this file.
Two came from the maintainer while 0.6.1 was built (*How a program runs* gets simpler; two
styles for setting an input), and the third is where a reading of the site collects.

## After 0.6.1 — two symbols that want `?`: `??` and `c ? a : b`

**When:** after 0.6.1, as ONE plan for both. The maintainer placed it first after 0.6.0 on
2026-10-05, and named 0.6.1 for the editor on 2026-10-08, which comes before it by its number.
Asked on 2026-10-05, as "`||` as sugar on `Default`" and "an inline if, `condition ? true : false`".

**Why one plan:** three ideas want `?`: these two, and the optional lambda parameter
(`backlog.md`). The first one built fixes what the lexer does with `?`, `??` and `?:`, so the plan
settles all three spellings, even if it builds two.

**`??` for `Default`, not `||`** (probed 2026-10-05). `||` is taken: it is sugar over `Or`, `Or`
takes booleans, and `null || 5` is `op_input_type_mismatch` today. A symbol becomes its op while
the parser reads, before any type is known, so `||` cannot choose between `Or` and `Default` by
type. The other way is an `Or` that accepts `any` and decides at runtime, and then the reference
prints a signature that is not honest, which is what keeps `+` from text (`backlog.md`). `Default`
tests for `null`, not for false, and that is what other languages spell `??`.
`registerInfix("??", …)` is plain sugar, as `++` is over `Join`, and a registered symbol reaches
the lexer through `grammar.symbols`. **To decide:** its tier in the ladder (`precedence.ts` has
room below `OR`).

**`condition ? a : b` for `If`.** Sugar over `If(condition, a, b)`, so it inherits what `If` does:

- **Both branches are evaluated** ("`If` evaluates both branches", `backlog.md`). A reader of `?:`
  expects the opposite more than a reader of `If(…)` does. Decide whether the symbol waits for a
  lazy `If`, or ships with the fact said in the docs.
- **Its type** is the branches' type when they agree, and `any` when they differ (`If`'s
  `inferOutput`).
- **The registration has no route today.** `registerInfix` builds a symbol with two operands. A
  conditional needs a led that reads two more, and `registerLed` does not add its key to
  `grammar.symbols`, so the lexer still answers `unknown_character` for `?` (probed). It should
  not go in the core grammar either, which names no stdlib op. The smallest fix is a way to
  register a symbol with a hand-written led.
- **To decide:** its tier (between `ARROW` and `OR`), whether `a ? b : c ? d : e` chains, and
  that a `:` inside the first branch still reads (a lambda's annotation,
  `c ? (x: number) => x : y`).

**No consumer but the wish:** `If` and `Default` work. Estimate: a plan, then about three commits
(one per symbol, one for the docs).

## Core — two styles for setting an input: the runtime's and an instance's

**What:** asked by the maintainer on 2026-10-09, while the *Embedding core* sample was planned:
look at the difference in style between setting a global input and setting a program input.
The page shows the two side by side:

```ts
runtime.updateInputs({ temperature: 30 }); // your state, every program
instance.setInput("limit", 35);            // this program's own input
```

**How they differ today** (`runtime/runtime.ts`, `runtime/instance.ts`):

| | A global input | A program-level input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Call | `runtime.updateInputs(changes)` | `instance.setInput(name, value)` |
| Shape | One record of several names | One name and one value a call |
| Returns | The outputs, per program | Nothing: it reports through the observables |
| A value that does not fit | Throws, and the batch changes nothing | Is refused: `value_does_not_fit` on `diagnostics` |
| The other kind's name | Not probed | Throws |

A runtime's program handle has a third: `setInput(name, value)`, which returns the outputs.
*Embedding core* gives the reason for two of the rows: a command of an instance returns nothing
and cannot throw for a value because a pane, or a client across a network, calls it.

**When:** not placed by the maintainer.

**What it requires:** first the question itself, which is not decided: whether the difference
is wanted, or whether an instance wants a batch (`setInputs`), or the two want one verb. Then a
plan: a change here is core's public API, the link's protocol carries `setInput` as a command,
and the docs name both calls on several pages.

## Docs — *How a program runs* gets simpler, and the complexity stays on *The chain*

**What:** asked by the maintainer on 2026-10-09: simplify the Learn page *How a program runs*,
and keep the complexity on *The chain* (How it works).

**The two pages today.** Both draw `<Chain>` and both walk the same steps:

| | *How a program runs* (Learn) | *The chain* (How it works) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File | `learn/how-a-program-runs.mdx` | `how-it-works/the-chain.mdx` |
| Size | 100 lines, 850 words | 210 lines, 1409 words |
| Sections | Lex, Parse, Compose, Analyse, Evaluate, "What each step may not do", "That is Learn" | Lex, Parse, Desugar, Compose, Analyse, Prune, Evaluate, "Why it is separate artefacts and not one pass" |

So the Learn page is 60 % of the reference page's length and has the same outline: a reader
of Learn meets the chain twice.

**When:** in the docs pass of 0.6.1 or straight after it; not placed by the maintainer.

**What it requires:** a plan first, with the maintainer, because it is a page's content and
not a fix. The questions for it: what a Learn reader needs from the page (a first reading, not
decided: one picture and a few sentences a step, each step linking to its section of *The
chain*); whether "What each step may not do" moves to *The chain*; and which other pages link
to this page's anchors (`content.test.ts` checks every internal link).

---

## Docs — review the rest of the site after Learn

**What:** the user is reading the docs page by page and sending observations. Learn comes first
(its observations were the samples step, now in `done.md`); **then** How it works, Host
developers and the stdlib reference, the same way. The site-wide passes (the colouring, the
dashes, the chain) already landed with the samples step, so these pages start from them.

**When:** next, alongside the inline TypeScript colouring: the user reads, and the
observations collect here until there is a section's worth to plan.

## Before 1.0.0 — what has no release named yet

Asked for by the maintainer on 2026-10-10: the todos that have no clear time, and that must
be done before a 1.0.0. The repo has no written definition of 1.0, so one rule sorts them:
**after 1.0.0, a change that breaks a program, a host's code or a saved file needs a 2.0.0.**
What only ADDS can come after. The list is being talked through; each row says where it stands.

**Agreed, the maintainer, 2026-10-10:**

| What | Why before 1.0.0 | Where it is written |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A review of the stdlib's names** | A rename or a move is a break, as the comparison ops' move to `logic` was in 0.6.0 | Here. With it: `Flatten`, which cannot type its output (`backlog.md`) |
| **The functions the stdlib still lacks** | Asked for with the review. Each one only adds, so it is here for completeness of a 1.0, not for the rule | `backlog.md`: "the rest of the string ops", "`Clamp` with one bound", "what the math batch left out" |
| **Strings as lists** ("probably should") | `Contains` and `Includes` would become one op, which removes a name | `backlog.md`, "Language — strings as lists"; possibly 0.8 in the order above |
| **A call to a name that is no op says so** | Today it is `undeclared_binding_reference`. A kind of its own changes what a host matches on | `backlog.md`, "Core — a call to a name that is no op" |
| **One style for setting an input** | The shape of `updateInputs` and `setInput`, and the link's protocol | Above, "Core — two styles for setting an input" |
| **What is public in the editor** | Hosts use its CSS variables and classes already (the docs site does). To be explained in detail when it is taken | `backlog.md`: "documenting the configs", "drill down on `LayoutConfig`" |
| **Beacon uses the API first** | The rule of `editor-plan.md`: publish after the first real consumer | `backlog.md`: "Subtyping — Beacon-side representation", "Op-declared context-input dependencies" |
| **The visual (Rete) half of the editor** | The project's stated target; a gate by decision, not by the rule | `backlog.md`, "Editor — the visual (Rete) half" |

**These have a release, so they are not rows here:** the next one holds `??`, `c ? a : b`, a
lazy `If` decided with them, and `AnalysisContext` leaving the public surface (the order at the
top of this file).

**Still being talked through** (each with the question that is open):

| What | The open question |
| --- | --- |
| **Union types** | As a type a host or an author may WRITE, they only add. As what a mixed list or an `If` INFERS, they turn a warning of today into an error. Which half, and when |
| **A struct type that names itself** | Refusing it is a break for a host that declares one, so the refusal wants to be before 1.0.0. Struct literals and struct types in code only add, and can follow |
| **A `null` through arithmetic** | Keep the rule of 0.6.0 for good (a `null` lasts one step), or let it reach the output as in SQL. The second changes results |
| **A value of the wrong type that crosses an `any`** | Today `Add("abc", 1)` is a text in a number output. Refuse it, or read it as the empty value, as a `null` is read |
| **`instance.setProgram` trusts its ports** | A fix, not a break. Whether it rides with the next release |
| **`Grammar`'s shape, and the flags on `OpInput`** | Say that the keys and the three booleans are API as they are, or change them first |
| **A `NaN` inside a list a host op returns** | A known ceiling. Whether it is a gate at all |

**Kept in mind, and may wait for 2.0.0:** versions of the documentation site
(`docs-plan.md` has "none before 1.0").
